## Project Summary

ALL ABOUT CINEMA is an all-in-one web application that helps movie lovers select what film they want to watch next. This may depend on what movies they’ve watched in the past, what genres the viewer likes, what directors they’ve liked in the past, and the actors they enjoy watching. If a direct search does not yield satisfying results, users can browse through what movies a specific director has worked on, and the average rating for each director. In the homepage, there will be recommendations for movies of  genres different from what the user has watched in the past but includes some of the same actors or has a high enough average rating. Other features include visualization of the user’s preferences through graphs comparing a number categories from the data of the reviews the user has entered. Mainly, the purpose of this application is to be a recommendation engine that also helps users to browse movies or TV shows and find useful information.
